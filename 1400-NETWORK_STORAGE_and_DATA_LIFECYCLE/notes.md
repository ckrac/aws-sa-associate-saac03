# Network Storage and Data Lifecycle

### EFS Architecture

- Elastic File System (EFS) is an AWS managed implementation of NFS which allows for the creation of shared 'filesystems' which can be mounted within multi EC2 instances
- **EFS** is an implementation of **NFSv4**
- EFS **Filesystems** can be mounted in **Linux**
- **shared** between many EC2 Instances
- private service, via **mount targets** inside a VPC
- can be accessed from on-premises - **VPN** or **DX**

- **Linux only**
- **general purpose** and **Max I/O** performance modes
- general purpose - **default** for 99.9% of uses
- **bursting** and **provisioned** throughput modes
- **standard** and **infrequent access (IA)** Classes
- lifecycle policies can be used with classes

- **backup plans** - frequency, window, lifecycle, vault, region copy
- **resources** - what resources are backed up
- **vaults** - backup **destination** (container) - assign KMS key for encryption
- vault **lock** - write-once, read-many (**WORM**), 72 hour cool off, then even AWS can't delete
- **on-demand** - manual backups created as needed
- **PITR** - point in time recovery
