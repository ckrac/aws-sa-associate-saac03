### Database Refresher & Models

_Relational (SQL) vs None-Relational (NoSQL)_

- Structured Query Language (**SQL**)
- structure **in** & **between** tables of data - **Rigid Schema**
- ...relationships between tables
- NoSQL - **not one single thing... different models**
- generally a much more relaxed schema
- relationships handled differently
