### Database Refresher & Models

_Relational (SQL) vs None-Relational (NoSQL)_

- Structured Query Language (**SQL**)
- structure **in** & **between** tables of data - **Rigid Schema**
- ...relationships between tables
- NoSQL - **not one single thing... different models**
- generally a much more relaxed schema
- relationships handled differently

### ACID vs BASE

- **ACID** and **BASE** are DB **transaction models**
- **CAP Theorem** - **Consistency**, **Availability**, **Partition Tolerant** (resilience) - **Choose 2** (DB is capable of delivering only two)
- **ACID** = consistency
- **BASE** = availability
