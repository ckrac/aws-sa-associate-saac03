# HA & Scaling

### Regional and Global AWS Architecture

- Global **Service Location** & **Discovery**
  - e.g when you type netflix.com into your browser, how does your machine discover where to point at?
- Content Delivery (**CDN**) and optimization
  - how does the content or data for an application get to users globally?
- Global **health checks** & **Failover**
  - detecting if infrastructure in one location is healthy or not and moving customers to another country as required
- regional **entry point**
- **scaling** & **resilience**
- application services and **components**
